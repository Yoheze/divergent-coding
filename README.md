This is the Web Application Offline Coding Test for Divergent 3D

If you need to see more skills in regards to my CSS or Database use, you can
check out my portfolio website for CSS (although it is still a work in progress): https://portfolio-yoheze.vercel.app/

For utilization of databases any of the other pinned projects on my github should show my skills with NoSQL and SQL databases.

To run this locally you must:
2. Go to client folder and run: npm run build
3. run: npm i and npm run dev in both the server and the client folder
